<h3> Book of Cagliostro </h3>
<p> Originally penned by the mystic Cagliostro in the 1780s, il Libro di Cagliostro (lit. "The Book of Cagliostro") is an account of Cagliostro's personal history, and a collection of mystic knowledge gathered from numerous sources, including passages of the Darkhold, notes from 31st century sorcerer Sise-Neg, as well as Cagliostro's own considerable knowledge.
Followers of Cagliostro were entrusted with guarding the book, which was passed down through the generations. It would come into the possession of a woman named Miarka, the mistress of Nikolai Mordo, who passed it to her daughter Lilia, who then passed it to her daughter, Lilia Calderu. Calderu would eventually be seduced by Karl Mordo, who then assaulted her and stole the Book of Cagliostro, hoping to use its power to defeat the Ancient One.
The Book of Cagliostro lay secure in the library of Kamar-Taj as part of the personal collection of the Ancient One, who had used the knowledge contained within to prolong her life for centuries. One night, Kaecilius entered the library, killed the librarian, and stole pages from the ancient tome. His purpose was to uncover the secret of communing with Dormammu, a being of immense power from another dimension. Initiate sorcerer Stephen Strange came across the book himself and began applying some of its content to make use of the Eye of Agamotto. He was interrupted in this task by Karl Mordo and Wong, both of whom knew the dangers he was toying with. The Book of Cagliostro was returned to its rightful place, although Strange later had reason to use its knowledge again when he and the others finally confronted Kaecilius. </p>
Mordo would eventually use the Book to travel back in time, hoping to convince a time-displaced Sise-Neg to take him on as an apprentice. Hoping to stop him, Calderu would help Dr. Strange track down the Book, which Strange used to track down Mordo.

<h3> Darkhold </h3>
<p> Eons ago, the evil Elder God known as Chthon wrote all his evil works and spells on indestructible parchment. Originally written on flesh before being transcribed to stone and later a collection of parchments often referred to as the Chthon Scrolls. The pages were later bound together into a tome, of the codex type, named "The Darkhold," and also called "The Shiatra Book Of The Damned" or "The Book Of Sins." It has served as the source for other such books of spells as the Necronomicon. Chthon left these scrolls on Earth so that they might always serve as a conduit to the Earth-Realm for Chthon's influence and power.[14]
The original flesh Darkhold, the true Darkhold, is currently fused with the Scarlet Witch.

<h3> Necronomicon </h3>
<p> The Necronomicon was a powerful tome of black magic created by Abdul Alhazred, the Mad Arab,in the 8th century.It was one of the most powerful tomes on magic, and presumably magnified Alhazred's powers.
The Necronomicon was derived from a small part of lore from the Shiatra Book of the Damned (The Darkhold), or patterned after it. The Darkhold was created by Chthon, one of the Elder Gods.

<h3> Book of Vishanti </h3>  
<p> The Book of the Vishanti contains the most powerful white/order magic spells known, many of them being counterspells to other magic disciplines. It seems to have an endless number of pages, which seemingly materialise from nothing. The book itself can be used to deflect magic. In addition, its spells can never be used for offense, only for defense. The Book is marked with the Seal of the Vishanti. It also contains extensive knowledge introduced by several powerful magicians, such as the information collected by Agamotto regarding his discovery and mastery of the "Three Paths to Enlightenment", and widely detailed information about the Marvel cosmology itself, which was presumably dictated by the Vishanti to the first human authors.</p>
